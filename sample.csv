"START NEXT ""Good morningI'm ### ### and I practice Child Welfare Child Support and Custody in ### County. I must preface my answer that the guidance I'm providing you does not reflect my personal opinions but is more of a reflection of my knowledge of the laws of TN and my experience of practicing Child Welfare for a number of years.The concerns you've expressed are more lifestyle choices. The possession of firearms in your home is a fundamental right. If the child's mother was present during the ### of firearms and she didn't object that is not actionable because she has the right to make parenting decisions while the child is with her. The presence of firearms in the home would be an issue if someone in the home (the bf) wasn't allowed by law to possess firearms. If by chance he was a felon.Same with the motorcycle issue. If the motorcycle operator is properly licensed and has a helmet and following other road safety laws then there is nothing actionable there either. If by chance the bf is not properly licensed there is a problem but not likely enough to change custody. The judge will admonish the child's mother to not let it happen again.In your situation there isn't enough for a judge to change the primary residential parent.

"START NEXT ""In Tennessee there are two types of divorces: uncontested and contested. In a contested divorce the spouses cannot agree and have to go to trial. Grounds for contested divorce in TN include abandonment or refusal or neglecting to provide for spouse although able to do so. Abandonment is when one spouse deliberately abandons the other spouse without justification for the purpose of ending the marriage. The abandonment period needs to be at least one year long.  Is your husband's name on the deed to the home? If so he will have to consent to the sale. Even if his name is not on the deed depending on how long you have been living in the home it will likely be considered to be the marital residence. Because of this he will most likely need to consent to the sale because he has a legal interest in the property. Additionally your husband may be entitled to income generated from the sale. The ultimate burden will be on you to prove that the home is non-martial property which would allow you to go about the sale without his consent. If you decide to file for divorce you can ask the court for temporary exclusive use and possession of the home. The court might order him to move out before the end of the divorce proceeding but they also might wait until the end. Because it sounds like your daughter and granddaughter are also living on the property the court will also take that into consideration when making their decision. """,0,0

He is correct in his response that you are not entitled to a default if you didn't file a non-military affidavit.  Family court does not allow one side to get any advantages by using procedural means such as defaults or time limits.  For instance if something like a financial disclosure is past due you cannot win a motion to compel discovery unless you have sent a letter giving them a time limit to respond.  The only real reprocussion for delay is possibly having to pay the opposing ### attorney fees for the filing of the motion to compel.

"START NEXT ""Hello I am a retired Massachusetts lawyer who has volunteered to respond to some of the landlord-tenant questions on Mass. Legal Answers On-Line (""MLAO"").  I will next be on-line on ###.  I will try to respond helpfully to your message.In general Massachusetts lease law binds each party to the ###s of the lease; and in the event of a premature vacate by the tenant the landlord is required to try to mitigate his losses by renting the apartment to another tenant as soon as possible at a fair market rent (which would end the tenant's lease obligation to pay the agreed rent for the rest of the agreed ###).  So it appears that the landlord in your case has asked you to ""sublet [your] room"" instead of the landlord's re-renting the apartment as soon as it can.  ""Sublet"" implies that you would be held to pay the remaining lease rent if your sub-tenant prematurely vacated the premises or stopped paying rent before the end of your lease ###. If you definitely are not going to move into this apartment I suggest that you notify the landlord [name on lease] and any manager and any attorney for the landlord of your decision not to take possession as planned and request that they start immediately to take steps to re-rent the apartment to another tenant to mitigate any rent claims that they might assert against you.  (Keep photocopies of your notices preferably sent by certified mail return receipt requested for potential legal purposes.  I think but am not certain that providing your mailing address in ### might be a good idea too because you could receive notices and correspondence there.  You might consider offering a check in the amount that you think is fair specifically noting on the check that it is to settle any claims by the landlord in connection with your withdrawing from the lease for good cause.)I am not sure what you meant by ""Prove that [you are] being forced to leave the U.S.""  Or rather I do not know what the landlord meant by that demand.  If they used the rather vague words ""prove"" and ""forced"" you probably could offer enough documentary evidence of those meanings -- your status as an international student the objective visa problems the cancellation of in-person classes or the exclusive nature of on-line classes etc.  You might find an ally at the Boston Globe -- I have seen its consumer affairs reporter solve writers' similar cancellation problems with time-share rentals (actually made impossible by international travel restrictions); and possibly he could intervene for you.  [Sorry I do not recall his name.]  On the other hand if they clearly meant that you are ""forced"" to leave because of your immigration status I have no ideas how to respond responsively to that demand.  (I did not do immigration law.)  You might just go ahead and provide your documentation of your reasons with your notice withdrawing from the lease and call it ""proof"" enough given the current pandemic and all other circumstances.  (If you plan to take on-line classes in ### simply to save money then you might calculate the cost of withdrawing from the Massachusetts lease in your valuation of your different options.)P.S.  I do not know your current circumstances or whereabouts and I do not know what legal action the landlord might take against you now or in the future.  Since you signed a Massachusetts lease it seems to me to be likely that the landlord could bring a legal action in Massachusetts courts which would have jurisdiction in connection with the lease claims against you even if you were then in ###.  A default judgment might be entered even if you did not appear in the Massachusetts case assuming it was properly accepted by the court.  You might have a right to transfer such a court case from the Massachusetts state courts to the U.S. federal courts; but I do not know if that transfer would actually help you.  If you are concerned about imminent or future legal proceedings against you it might be worthwhile for you to retain a competent Massachusetts attorney to look at your case and to advise you. Good luck.""",0,0
"START NEXT ""###The legal question you are asking is when is personal property left behind considered abandoned.  Unfortunately under Massachusetts law there is no clear time period that must run before property can be considered abandoned.   The law instead only requires that give notice of your intent to dispose of the property after giving a reasonable period of time to come claim it.  Here is what I recommend you do to protect yourself in case she later tries to come after you for getting rid of her property.Prepare an inventory of the abandoned personal property including a detailed list of the items and photographs that document each itemâ€™s condition.Move the property under the supervision of a neutral witness -- such as a neighbor who isnâ€™t involved in any disputes you may have with the tenant -- and store it in a safe place.  It can be somewhere on site.Write a letter to ex-roommate letting her know what the property is where it is and that you will dispose of it after a certain date if they donâ€™t reclaim it. Give the tenant at least two weeks to pick up the property.Hope this helps.Attorney ### ###""",0,0

"START NEXT ""Most leases make all tenants resposible for the full amount of the rent. A lease is a contract. The tenants agree to pay rent for the full ### of the lease. If the tenant moves out before the end of the lease the landlord may be able to sue the tenant for rent for the balance of the lease ###. The landlord should have to wait until the lease ### expires before he could make that claim. The landlord may have the obligation to mitigate his damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the apartment during the remainder of the lease ###. The best way to deal with this might be to make an agreement with the landlord to allow you to leave without being responsible for paying for rent after you leave. If you cannot afford to pay the rent and stop paying the rent your landlord would probably start an eviction for nonpament. This will cost the landlord money and he will lose money while that process makes its way through the court. It would probably make sense for the landlord to release you from your obligations under the lease so that he can re-rent the apartment and start collecting rent. Even if your landlord might be able to get a judgment against you that judgment may not be collectible. A court cannot order you to make payments from Social Security SSI and most pensions. If the landlord knows that he cannot actually collect on any judgment he may be able to get from a court against you he may be more likely to make an agreement to let you out of the lease without having to spend money on a court case.

"START NEXT ""Hi ###Because a court in another State entered a custody order under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (an act that has been adopted by ###) that states maintain exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the custody proceeding unless:A court of the state with jurisdiction determines that the child or the child and a parent do not have a significant connection with the state AND evidence concerning the child's custody determination is not available in the state; ORA court of the state with jurisdiction or any other state determines that the child and both parents or acting parents do not reside in the state any longer.In other words unless the other States determines it does not have jurisdiction (by meeting one of the two scenarios described above) or Florida determines that the child parents and any acting parent does not reside in the state that has jurisdiction that State that entered it maintains jurisdiction.   Because the father still lives in that State that entered the original custody order (I am assuming this is the case based on the information you provided) you do meet the second criteria.  Therefore a court in Florida cannot modify the order unless the State that entered the original order determines that the first criteria is met.

Look at the last paragraph.You have few if any rights in this situation. In fact you should be cautious because it is possible that the employer could report this to the Stateâ€™s Attorney who could choose to pursue criminal felony theft charges against you.

That would also be considered a possible crime.In any event please make every effort to gather every cent of the money overpaid to you. Do not keep any of it in reserve for a rainy day. Do not hide any of it. Do not pay back other debts with it. Do not ask someone to hold it for you. Do not buy things with the money (or if you have already done so try to return them or re-sell them to convert them back into cash). If you have given some of it away as gifts ask for it back. In other words do whatever you can to get as much of that money back into your hands.Your objective needs to be to pay back the money. If any of the money is left you should plan to return that to the employer in its entirety in one lump sum as soon as an agreement is reached on a pay back plan.** Iâ€™d like to help you more so could you please reply here to let me know what has happened to the overpaid funds. Knowing this is the only way I can really assist you. Your email and my response will be confidential as allowed under the attorney Rules of Professional Conduct. Please let me know how much money is left and how much more of it you can get back. With this information maybe I can help you draft a response to your former employer.###"" NEXT ""Hi ###Thank you so very much for your help. I really appreciate it.

By returning some large sum at the time an agreement is reached you will be showing your good faith helping to keep the employer quiet about the whole issue and also reducing the amounts of your payments.

I think it would be best for both of us if we each agreed as a part of this to keep this agreement and the situation which led to it as confidential. I will not say anything bad about Civitas and Civitas will not say anything bad about me.I think the agreement should have a date when the monthly payment is due to be postmarked on the envelope (plus a ### and a $###). I suggest that the postmarked date be the ### of every month. The agreement should indicate the exact address where the payments should be mailed and if you wish as an alternative at my choice an electronic deposit site. The repayment agreement and individual payments will not be reported to a credit agency. I would also like to have a note in the agreement that if I become unemployed again and am unable to pay the monthly amounts I can suspend the payments for up to three months or until I am re-employed whichever occurs first.Your email said you would send me a more formal agreement outlining the terms.

Do you think it's worth it to inquire about this difference before going into details about the payment plan? Or should I just send the terms you helped me draft? Thanks so much and have a great weekend!"" NEXT ""###You're doing great with them. I think you should send them an email with your number ($24098.42) and the terms we drafted together. But you should add something like:Thank you for looking at your calculations again. I noticed that we have still come to slightly different final numbers: $24593.###. $24098.42. I am hoping you can ask someone to again look at the amounts actually deposited in my account. I have done that at least twice and come to the total of $24098.### so I am fairly confident in my sum. I don't want that to delay our discussion of repayment so (using the figure of $24098.42) here are my thoughts about it.I appreciate your proposal of a repayment schedule. Unfortunately like many others right now I am unemployed and cannot afford a guaranteed repayment schedule. However I would like to suggest to you another option which I think is good for both of us. By various actions I believe I can obtain a lump sum payment which would be added to reduced size installment payments deferred to start in six months so I may find adequate employment. Therefore the plan would be that upon us both signing an agreement Civitas would take no actions against me by itself or through some other group or entity) and I would promise to pay back the entire $24098.###:###. An immediate payment from me to Civitas of $###5###37.00 leaving a remainder owed of $896###.52;2. ### $###.### with the first payment to begin six months after the lump sum payment;3. I think it would be best for both of us if we each agreed as a part of this to keep this agreement and the situation which led to it as confidential. I will not say anything bad about Civitas and Civitas will not say anything bad about me.I think the agreement should have a date when the monthly payment is due to be postmarked on the envelope (plus a ### and a $###) or dated on an electronic transaction. I suggest that the postmarked/transaction date be the ### of every month. The agreement should indicate the exact address where the payments should be mailed and if you wish as an alternative at my choice an electronic deposit site. The repayment agreement and individual payments will not be reported to a credit agency. I would also like to have a note in the agreement that if I become unemployed again and am unable to pay the monthly amounts I can suspend the payments for up to three months or until I am re-employed whichever occurs first.Your email said you would send me a more formal agreement outlining the terms. I am fine with that if we agree on the above but I also ask that the agreement not include a lot of legal jargon and things like suing for lawyersâ€™ fees. I think we should keep this simple and I promise you it will be repaid to Civitas.Please let me know what you think about this. Thank you.### Because the total amount owed has changed so much if you needed to reduce the immediate payment slightly by $###### that should be fine. You would just need to make adjustments to the other calculations such as the remaining balance owed and the monthly payment due for ###. Also please remember to fill in the blank space about your preferred day of the month to make the monthly installment payments.I hope you have a great holiday weekend. Please be sure to let me know how Civitas replies.###"" NEXT ""Hi ###I had to change the numbers in my response a bit because I have not been able to get a hold of as much cash as I had hoped quickly enough. The numbers I presented reflect what I have available at the moment. I was pretty confident these numbers would work for them because they had been pretty flexible thus far and did not initially ask for a lump sum. Here is how they replied: Hi ###I appreciate the ### in this email. Your plan on repayment is fine and we can agree to $24098.42.  I'll send a formal agreement that we both will sign and will include a confidentiality clause as well.  We would like to auto deduct the amount through bill.com would this work for you?

Thanks so much!###"" NEXT ""### If you want to talk by phone about this draft agreement from Civitas just give me a call (###-###). Otherwise I put my thoughts down in writing. I have some real concerns about their version of the agreement. Here are the parts of their version I am concerned about and why they bother me. Then I have written up a proposed email you can send back to Civitas today which explains these concerns along with a redraft of their agreement. Just let me know what you think about it. Civitas Version of Repayment Agreement â€œ### also agrees that he will be required to reimburse the Company for its attorneysâ€™ fees and costs associated with such recovery and pay any applicable interest accruing after payment was due and owing if deemed appropriate by a court of law.â€¿ Including this provision for attorneys fees and costs is directly contrary to your instructions to them that you donâ€™t want the agreement to have anything in the agreement about suing for lawyers fees. It also allows them to sue you for an amount which ends up being more than the amount of the debt.Also they have added a really vague provision here about accruing interest to which they would not have been entitled except for this agreement. Fortunately it is so badly written that a judge would likely have no idea how to interpret it or how to calculate it. â€œ### agrees to waive any statute of limitations argument in the event he fails to comply with the repayment terms of this Agreement and the Company files suit against him to collect the Overpayment.â€¿ This is weird and at least proves it was not written by a lawyer. It doesnâ€™t indicate if it refers to a statute of limitations on the original total debt amount or the one on this agreement (which is all they need). It shouldnâ€™t be in here but itâ€™s up to you whether to use it as leverage to get rid of other things. â€œNothing contained in this Agreement prohibits any of the Parties from communicating with any government agency filing a complaint with a government agency or otherwise participating in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any government agency.â€¿ In my opinion this needs to be deleted from this agreement in order to protect you from someone at Civitas reporting you to the police. We wanted a confidentiality agreement and that should include them keeping this confidential from reporting this to government agencies unless compelled by law to do so. â€œThe Company agrees that it will direct Lahari Goud and Kevyn ### that while they continued to be employed by the Company they will not disclose the terms of this Agreement to any third party specifically including without limitation any past present or prospective employee of the Company any customer of the Company or to any representative of any media. This Paragraph shall not apply to communications between the Companyâ€™s accountants and attorneys or any disclosure or statement relating to any proceeding to enforce the terms of this Agreement or to a government agency or as expressly authorized by law or lawful process.â€¿ First who are Lahari Goud and Kevyn ### and why is Civitas limiting this to them? Iâ€™m guessing they are executives there. Second there is no reason it should be limited to â€œwhile they continue to be employed by the companyâ€¿. There are plenty of things which executives and employees are asked to keep secret even after they leave a company and this can be one of them. Third the duty to keep it confidential must also include Civitas as an entity. Fourth this would be the logical place to indicate that Civitas and its staff will not initiate any report to a governmental or quasi-governmental entity including but not limited to law enforcement of the circumstances underlying the overpayment and repayment of funds except as required by law. Finally the confidentiality applies not just to the agreement but also to the circumstances underling the agreement.  Responding to Civitas with Our Version of Repayment Agreement I assume you have looked at the numbers in their proposed agreement and that they are OK. If not now is the time to speak up and make changes. Your response to Civitas should have a counter agreement to send back. I will try to send a PDF version of that to you but also here is a proposed email you can send to them of course subject to whatever changes you want to make depending on how you measure their moods. _______________________________________________________ TO: Civitas Thank you for sending the proposed agreement to me. I was hoping we could have a very simple agreement without a lot of legal jargon but I guess things donâ€™t work that way now. I spent a lot of time reading it and thinking about it and I made some changes so we can move on and Iâ€™m still protected. I attached a scan of the whole changed version which I prepared but I also explain it here. The first three paragraphs seem OK. After that some things get to be a problem so hereâ€™s what I changed it to. If ### fails to make any of the payments described above the Company may immediately seek repayment in a court of law seeking the remaining balance of the total Overpayment. ### also agrees that he will be required to reimburse the Company for its attorneysâ€™ fees and costs associated with such recovery and pay any applicable interest accruing after payment was due and owing if deemed appropriate by a court of law. ### agrees to waive any statute of limitations argument in the event he fails to comply with the repayment terms of this Agreement and the Company files suit against him to collect the Overpayment. MY COMMENT: In one of my emails about our agreement I specifically asked that we not include anything about suing for lawyer fees because those end up costing as much as the amount of the debt and it never gets paid off. Also I donâ€™t want anything about interest. Civitas would not have been able to get interest on the amount of the overpayment debt originally and it is wrong that it should try to get interest from me just because I am agreeing to repay it by agreement. Again it just turns into accumulating debt that never gets paid off. On the statute of limitations sentence I donâ€™t really understand it because if I donâ€™t pay under this agreement I think youâ€™d have a long time to sue me for the payment but if you want it there Iâ€™ll compromise. Nothing contained in this Agreement prohibits any of the Parties from communicating with any government agency filing a complaint with a government agency or otherwise participating in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any government agency. MY COMMENT: This is exactly one of the things which I need to stop from occurring. It does me no good to agree to repay money only to find out that Civitas has turned around and reported me to the police department for theft or something like that. There is no legal requirement that Civitas and its people file a complaint against me with a law enforcement agency or some government agency which will report it to a law enforcement agency. I cannot sign an agreement with this in it. The reason why I asked for the confidentiality provision is to prevent this. I can only imagine me signing this agreement. Paying Civitas $### agreeing to pay $### and then end up getting arrested because Civitas reports me to the Stateâ€™s Attorneyâ€™s office. Preventing Civitas from reporting this to the police must be included two paragraphs below. ### agrees that neither he nor his agents will disclose the terms of this Agreement to any third party specifically including without limitation any past present or prospective employee of the Company any customer of the Company or to any representative of any media. This Paragraph shall not apply to communications between ### and his spouse accountants and attorneys any disclosure or statement relating to any proceeding to enforce the terms of this Agreement or to a government agency or as expressly authorized by law or lawful process. The Company agrees that it will direct Lahari Goud and Kevyn ### that while they continued to be employed by the Company they will not disclose the terms of this Agreement to any third party specifically including without limitation any past present or prospective employee of the Company any customer of the Company or to any representative of any media. The Company agrees that it as a business entity and its executive staff including but not limited to Lahari Goud and Kevyn ### will not disclose the terms of this Agreement and the circumstances underlying it which led to the above described overpayment and repayment to any third party specifically including without limitation any past present or prospective employee of the Company any customer of the Company any representative of any media any persons making contact with the Company for work references for ### or to any government agency or department (except as legally required to do). This Paragraph shall not apply to communications between the Companyâ€™s accountants and attorneys or any disclosure or statement relating to any proceeding to enforce the terms of this Agreement or to a government agency or as expressly required authorized by law or lawful process. The Company shall not file any complaint or charges or initiate an investigation or legal process with any law enforcement agency or a government agency which would likely report to a law enforcement agency regarding the actions of ### in the overpayment repayment or failure to repay and by signing this agreement the Company agrees that it is not aware of any such complaints charges or investigations which have been initiated. MY COMMENT: As I wrote above this is important. I wasnâ€™t very worried about it before but the paragraph in your other draft of the agreement that says it is OK for Civitas to file a complaint with a government agency has me concerned. My preference is that you be honest with me upfront. If that is your intention please let me know now. I am relying on these words. ### acknowledges that the terms of this Agreement are reasonable in all respects and that he has voluntarily agreed to these terms. ### is free to avoid all responsibilities to the Company under this Agreement by paying the full amount of any remaining Overpayment due to the Company."" NEXT ""Hi ###First I must explain the delay-- some personal things happened this week that forced my attention from this matter. All the while I was ### over the agreement and proposed changes. With that said thank you very much for your suggestions they are a good reminder that I should not rely on Civitas' good ### or expect them to continue in the future-- the language of the agreement must be clearer and there are parts that should be removed. I thought carefully about the edits and I agree to them. I do however want to alter the tone a bit so as not to fall onto their bad ### as so far they have shown willingness to work with me. As I see it they have the cards so I don't want to anger them and lose what we've agreed to so far. Here's what I'm thinking of sending leaving your changes to the agreement intact. Let me know what you think and I'll send it over to them. Ms Goud Thank you for your patience as I read and thought about the proposed agreement. As you may imagine this is a very serious matter for me so I carefully considered these proposed changes so that I can return the overpaid amount and still have some protection. I attached a scan of the whole changed version which I prepared but I also explain my reasoning here. The first three paragraphs seem okay. After that some things get a little problematic for me so hereâ€™s what I propose: If ### fails to make any of the payments described above the Company may immediately seek repayment in a court of law seeking the remaining balance of the total Overpayment. ### also agrees that he will be required to reimburse the Company for its attorneysâ€™ fees and costs associated with such recovery and pay any applicable interest accruing after payment was due and owing if deemed appropriate by a court of law. ### agrees to waive any statute of limitations argument in the event he fails to comply with the repayment terms of this Agreement and the Company files suit against him to collect the Overpayment.

Thank you###"""" NEXT """"### Another thought: I predict that they will have an issue with removing the part about lawyer fees if I fail to make a payment because it's supposed to serve as an incentive to not miss any payments. Is there an alternative we can propose as a similar sort of incentive? They could still take me to court under our most current draft of the agreement but if they have to cover their legal fees they probably would not think it would be worth it so could they see our latest proposal as a play to leave room for me to not pay the total amount in the future? Just trying to anticipate what their response may be. Thanks so much ######"""" NEXT """"I'm not sure what the alternative would be. They already indicated that if you miss one payment the whole deal is off and you will have to pay back everything in one lump sum immediately. That's a pretty big disincentive to not miss a payment. Maybe you could suggest that you will pay one-half of their attorneys fees subject to the court's approval of the reasonableness of the fees.Let me know what they have to say.###"""" NEXT """"Hi Steve I hope the start of your week is going well. Here's what Civitas sent me today including an attachment of their newest version of the agreement:--------AlexPlease take a look at the attached agreement.  I've added some of  your changes.  However I did keep the language around government agencies but added that this will only occur if payment is not made.  If payment is not made I don't believe that will be the case but if it does happen we may have to report it.I also changed the first payment from 6/### 6/25.Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.Thanks--------I'm a bit surprised by the change in the language around the amount owed. They have gone from only mentioning the amount we agreed on ($24098.68) to saying that the overpayment amount is really $35022.89 (the amount the originally said I owed). I now realize this amount is likely their net cost (including taxes) but never did give a justification. Thanks for any insight and apologies that this is dragging on longer than I thought it would-- it seems like they are choosing to be quite difficult about this. Thanks again for everything Steve """" NEXT """"I agree it is surprising they would change the overpayment amount to $### instead of $24k especially without saying anything about the change. It seems pretty weasel-like to me. If a lawyer did this he could probably be called out for using """"sharp practices"""" (and not in a good way). It's significant though because they now want you to become responsible for repayment of the full amount of the """"overpayment"""" if you default so there's a big difference between ### 24. I think you should call them out on it and say something like """"We are so close to having an agreement and then you changed the amount of the overpayment to me from $24xxx [you fill in the exact amount] which you had previously agreed was the correct amount to $35xxx [you fill in the correct amount] which was the original incorrect amount. If we change this figure back again to the correct amount and add a few days for payment of the lump sum (because of the delays) then I think we will have a deal to be signed.

Do you think I should just ask them to fix this sentence and then sign? Everything else seem okay to you?Thanks a ton ###"""" NEXT """"###I think you should leave that sentence in the third paragraph in. It actually works in your favor in the event they would ever try to get you to pay some of the amount they paid in taxes and it doesn't really hurt your position.Because I'm on vacation I don't have access to all the other drafts and my notes but I think this is everything we talked about. If there's anything else you remember let me know but I think this looks pretty good. I'd say it's good to sign and have them sign. When you give them the signed copy keep one copy for yourself and give them a letter asking them to sign and to then provide you with an original signed copy of the agreement as soon as possible. Tell them that as soon as you receive the fully signed agreement you will provide the lump sum payment. Then you should make arrangements to get the lump sum payment to them right away.I think I see a light at the end of the tunnel! Let me know if there's a problem. Otherwise I'll look forward to hearing that you've completed the deal! ### """" NEXT """"Did everything get signed? """" NEXT """"Hi ###Everything was signed finally.

Be aware that if you do not make arrangements for the settlement money your assets will be above the countable income and resources limit for SSI ($###### $######) and it will adversely affect your SSI eligibility.I strongly recommend that you use your personal injury settlement and establish an irrevocable Special Needs Trust also known as a Supplemental Needs Trust for your sole benefit.

"START NEXT ""For clarification you should understand that there is no longer any such thing as ""custody""  or ""50/###"" under Illinois law.  The law now refers to parental responsibility which is the right to make certain important decisions for the child and parenting time which is how much time the child spends with each parent.Child support is no longer calculated by a percentage of the noncustodial parent's income according to the number of children (the 28% you refer to).  Instead child support is calculated according to the net income that each parent has and how many nights the child spends with each parent.  Without these figures it is not possible to calculate child support.  Nor is it true that equal parenting time ""negates"" monetary child support (nor has that ever been true).What percentages of home equity and retirement accounts you would receive in the divorce depends on what the judge would award or what the parties agree upon.  It is not necessarily 50%.  It could be more or less depending on the existence of other assets (or debts) and circumstances of the individual case.By statute an inheritance is a non-marital asset not subject to division in a divorce.Your husband is either ignorant concerning divorce law or not being honest with you.

"START NEXT ""Greetings ###.  The document you want to execute is called a ""power of attorney.""  That is a document by which a person gives another person the authority to act on their behalf when doing certain things - in this case raising your child.  A guardianship is a legal proceeding through which a judge grants someone those powers and is significantly more complicated.  A grant of authority using a power of attorney can be revoked by you at any time while revoking a guardianship would require court action.  I have attached a 1-page PDF document that you could use for this purpose if you choose.  It is likely to be superior to whatever you might find online.  I strongly suggest signing it before a notary so that it is more likely to be accepted when your mother tries to use it. You need to know that you could incur financial obligations as a result of your mother's actions if you give her a power of attorney.  For example if she gets your child medical treatment or counseling you may be financially responsible. You should also be aware that the attached document is a ""durable"" power of attorney which means that it continues to be effective in the event of your disability such as if you are in an accident.  No power of attorney can be effective after your death so it is a good idea to make a will that says who you want to care for your children if you pass.

Sexual harassment is defined (by the EEOC) as being:  â€œ[### sexual advances requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating hostile or offensive work environment.â€? The conduct must be ""severe and pervasive"" not just isolated or petty.  It must be severe enough for it to be offensive intimidating and hostile to reasonable people.  An employer is automatically liable for sexual harassment by a supervisor when it results in an adverse employment action (like a failure to promote).  However if the harassment by a supervisor does not result in an adverse employment action an employer will not be held liable if it reasonably tried to prevent (for example with a written sexual harassment policy and training sessions) and promptly correct the harassing behavior and the employee being harassed unreasonably failed to take advantage of any corrective or preventative opportunities (for example the employee did not lodge a complaint pursuant to a written complaint procedure).If the harassment is perpetrated by  a co-worker an employer may be liable for it if the employer knew or should have know about it and failed to do anything about it.  For example if harassment was taking place right in front of a manager or supervisor an employer might be deemed to have knowledge of the harassment.  if the harassed employee files a formal written complaint with supervisors or HR the employer would definitely be deemed to have knowledge of it and must try to do something to stop it (separate the employees discipline the harassers etc.).  Please do not hesitate to email back with more information and answers to my questions - the more information i have the better I can answer you questions.  One thing I would suggest however is that if you feel as though you were discriminated against please go to the EEOC immediately to see about filing a charge of discrimination (time is running).

"START NEXT ""Based on the information you provided I don't see how you could be legally required to move before the DHA apartment becomes available in August. Your landlord cannot require you to move without an order from a court after a legal court eviction (summary process) action. Your landlord cannot start an eviction case until your tenancy has ###inated. If you have a lease (a written rental agreement for a fixed ###) your landlord shouldn't be able to start an eviction until your lease ends. If you do not have a lease you are a tenant at will. The law requires a rental period notice to ###inate a tenancy at will. The notice must be received by you at least one full rental period in advance and must ###inate your tenancy on a ""rent day"" which the day of the month that your rent is due.  If you post a copy of the notice I can tell you if the notice your landlord gave you is proper. Assuming that the notice your landlord gave you is the proper notice your tenancy would expire at the end of that notice period. Once your tenancy has been ###inated your landlord can start a summary process eviction if you have not moved. You are not required to move until a court orders you to move in an eviction action. If your landlord starts an eviction you should file an answer stating any claims and defenses you have to the eviction. You can and should also request Discovery to get information about the case from the landlord. You can find the Answer and Discovery forms here along with instructions; https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/evictions-court-formsIf your landlord brings the eviction case in the District Court you can and should transfer the case to the housing court. You can find a transfer notice form here: https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/evictions-court-formsBoth the District Court and the Housing Courts are currently using a procedure which splits the eviction process into at least two separate events. In the District Court the first tier event is a case management conference. In the Housing Court it's called a status conference. Mediation is available in the Housing Court at the status conference. If the case is not resolved with an agreement at the first tier event the court will schedule the case for trial. Depending on the ###ination date in your notice to quit it is highly unlikely that your case will be scheduled for trial before August. I may be able to give you more information once I see the notice.If your landlord is ###inating your tenancy because he wants to raise the rent this is considered a ""no fault"" eviction. Any claim that you have against your landlord can be a defense to a no-fault eviction. The court will decide how much to award you for your claims and offset that against the rent that is owed. If you owe a balance you would have seven days to pay that balance and stop the eviction. Even if you have no defenses to the eviction you can ask the court for more time to move if you have not found a place to move. The court can give you up to ### (### ###).More information about your rights and the eviction process is available at ### and ###Regarding the landlord's attempt to raise your rent a tenancy is a contract. Your landlord can't raise your rent during the ### of that contract. In fact your landlord can never raise your rent without you agreeing to the increase.

This is sometimes called a ""###."" The notice must ###inate your tenancy on a ""rent day"" which is the day of the month on which your rent is due. Your landlord can offer you a new tenancy at an increased rent after the current tenancy ends. You can accept that offer or you can refuse it.

Your landlord cannot evict you for nonpayment so long as you continue to pay the old rent.

I would argue that this notice is invalid. As I noted in my original post a notice to quit must terminate your tenancy on a day when your rent is due. If your rent is due on the ###st this notice may be invalid because it says that you must leave by ### on ###. This would not give you a full rental period notice. You can raise this as a defense to the eviction or by a motion to dismiss in any eviction case. I suggest that you do not bring this to your landlord's attention before any eviction as the landlord could send you a proper notice to replace the one that was sent. If the harassment is severe you could file a case in housing court for breach of quiet enjoyment. You mentioned ""threats"" but didn't specify what they are.

Have you considered filing a regular law suit to seek damages for the vet and medicine bills you are likely to have to pay over the life of the dog due to the false representations made about it's breed?  That would be a claim for fraud as well as for violations of the Oklahoma Consumer Protection Act.  Because a dog is considered  Uniform Commercial Code you would also have remedies under that Code.  And whether you go to small claims or full court you have a claim for breach of contract as well as fraud.Under your fraud claim you should ask for damages for the dog not being hypoallergic.  If you plan to keep the dog the court might reduce the amount of the damages for breach of contract i.e. what you paid and reduce them to the TRUE value of the dog which you will have to PROVE in court - it's true value as is.I would also ask for damages for the lost time and cost of traveling to and from Oklahoma to get the dog and to pursue your claims in court.  So have your lost time calculated before the hearing as well as the cost of gasoline (mileage).That said  even if you win you might not be able to collect from the breeder. Collecting on a judgment is another ball game if the defendant doesn't voluntarily pay.So be sure that if the court orders you to give back the dog that you don't do it until you receive CERTIFIED funds.Is it possible to contact the other people on Yelp who might want to join in a lawsuit and share the cost of an attorney?Yes I would most certainly contact the ### - especially if you want to stop the breeder from doing this to other buyers.  If the ### won't register her dogs people won't buy them or at least won't pay as much.  Has the breeder got a facebook page?  Just be sure that whatever you post info on that page or anywhere on the internet is TRUE and you have PROOF it is true - like the results of the genetic test.  However I would NOT post anything until after the lawsuit is concluded.Good luck.""

When you gave the deposit your landlord should have given you a paper that shows where the security deposit is being held.Second by law a landlord must return the tenant's security deposit within ### (returned keys/moved out of the property). So if you have not yet moved out the obligation to return the security deposit has likely not yet been triggered. The landlord is allowed to subtract money from the deposit for any unpaid rent (unless you withheld rent for bad living conditions in the apartment).Third as to last month's rent you already paid that money should be used for the last month that you live in the apartment. That is not something that is normally returned after you move out of the property.Fourth before you go to small claims court you might want to consider sending a demand letter to your landlord after you move out. Use Form 5 the Security Deposit Demand Letter from the Mass.gov website. It is a simple form you can fill out.  Keep a copy for yourself and send it to your landlord via certified mail (with return receipt) and first class mail.

"START NEXT ""Ms. ### with such a short deadline and no time for an attorney to review your filings and that of your employer I can just give you general guidance.  To be eligible for unemployment compensation you have to lose your job for no reason of your own.  If you are terminated for cause (like you didn't show up or stole from the employer) or if you quit you typically are not eligible for unemployment.  Many folks believed the ""fear"" of catching COVID was a sufficient reason not to go to work but if your employer remained open and expected you to perform your job they would be legally able to fire you for cause.  If you have an underlying health condition that required accommodation (under the ### or other COVID legislation) or in fact had COVID and they did not provide you such you may be able to argue that you didn't quit but were effectively terminated.  In the end it is up to the employer to show that your job remained and that you did not show for work.  Regardless of what facts you try to offer to show that you were eligible you may also want to indicate that should the adjudicator not find in your favor you would like the overpayment waived.  Our system was overwhelmed by folks seeking to live on unemployment during the pandemic which is why it is taking so long for them to process and come back to folks who they believe didn't qualify.  For that argument you would basically be saying you shouldn't have to pay so much because of the delay of the state in processing this account.   """,,

"START NEXT ""###Thanks for posting your question . . . I can imagine this is a stressful and traumatic situation.  Have you tried calling the police or Sheriff to see if they'll do something about this and enforce your custody judgment?  It depends on the department whether they get involved in these matters.A Family Access Motion may or may not work in your instance.  That's usually for minor disputes but if he is completely withholding custody from you you may need to do something further.  To start with Family Access Motions are set up so that the Clerk's in the local court should assist you.  As a result I'd go back to the Court that issued your custody judgment and ask if they have instructions or form to file a Family Access Motion.  They should be able to tell you what you need.  Each County may have their own forms that they want you to use.  For example St. ### County's preprinted form for Family Access Motions can be found here: https://www.st###co.com/Portals/8/docs/Document%20Library/circuit%20court/Forms/Family%20Court/CCFC118.pdf  If your county doesn't have such a form you can always retype the St. ### County one but change it to your particular County.  My guess is if custody is being withheld you may need to file a Motion for Contempt asking the judge to jail or fine him if he doesn't comply.  You could also possibly use his refusal to comply with the custody judgment as grounds for modifying the custody judgment n your favor.  But those are actions that you'd most likely need an attorney for.  You can go here for further resources and assistance including obtaining a reduced ### bono attorney: ###I hope this helps a little :-)  If you have any follow-up questions please don't hesitate to reply to this message.

"START NEXT ""###Thanks for posting your question.  I'm glad to try to point you in the right direction.  Please note that a Power of Attorney and a Guardianship are ###.  A Power of Attorney (POA) is a document where someone appoints a person or persons to make decisions for them and handle their personal and financial affairs on their behalf.  A POA terminates upon that person's death.  In order to draft a POA it must be signed before a notary public and the person signing it must be legally competent to do so.  That POA can easily be revoked by drafting a new document revoking it or by drafting a new POA changing the agents that are appointed and revoking all previous ### -  each of those documents must be signed by the person who created the original POA and that person must be legally competent to do so.  If the person who signed the original POA is no longer legally competent to change it or sign a new POA that POA cannot be revoked by him/her.  At that point the only way to get rid of that POA would be to go to court and have a judge revoke it.  Please note that just because someone is at the beginning stages of ### that doesn't automatically mean that the person is  not legally competent.  It depends on how sever the disease is.  That's going to be a judgment call by the attorney and possibly that person's doctor.A Guardianship is something completely different.  A Guardian is a Court-appointed person who makes decisions for that person and handles all of their affairs.  A guardianship usually takes away that person's ability to make decision for themselves as it rests solely with that Court appointed guardian.  If there is a Court-appointed guardian the person can't simply revoke that.  It can only be revoked by the Court.  Someone would have to go back to court and request that the guardianship be revoked and the person restored or that a new Guardian be appointed.  These can be complicated court actions that should involve an attorney.The bottom line is that if there is just a POA and no court appointed guardian if your friend is competent she can contact an attorney and do a new POA getting rid of her current agent and appointing you (if that's what she wants to do).  If there is a court appointed guardian serving someone would have to go back to Court to get that changed.Hopefully this answers your question.  If you have any follow up questions please don't hesitate to reply to this message.  Otherwise I wish you the best of luck with this matter.###"" NEXT ""I understand perfectly thank you so very much!""",1,1

You said that your mother has paid off the balance and still lives in the apartment. Has she contacted the landlord to ask that the case be dismissed? I suggest that you try to have the judgment against you vacated and the claim against you dismissed. The landlord may be willing to file an agreement to vacate the judgment and dismiss the case against you. If the landlord is not willing to do this by agreement you can file a motion for relief from judgment. I may be able to advise you on how to do that once you answer the questions I asked above.Even if you are not able to get the judgment vacated  you may be able to appeal any housing denial. If you were not a named tenant on the lease you would not have been responsible for the rent and should not have had a judgment enter against you. "" NEXT ""Did you get a notice saying that you were rejected from housing because of the eviction judgment? If so please post a copy of that notice.

Contacting the court will not be enough. You will need to file a motion to vacate the judgment. If the landlord ### (agrees) to the motion the court will allow the motion possibly without even have to schedule a hearing. If the landlord will not assent to the motion you can file a motion to vacate the judgment. If the landlord opposes the motion the court will decide whether to allow it. It may be difficult for you to get the judgment vacated. If you signed the lease you probably were legally responsible for paying the rent along with your mother. If you did not appear in court a judgment entered against you by default. You could try to get the default judgment vacated. You would need to show two things: (###) that you had a good reason why you did not appear in court and (###) that you had a defense to the eviction. The documents in the eviction case are not scanned into the online court system so I can't view them. I understand that you did not know about the eviction which would explain why you did not appear in court. However if service of the eviction complaint was properly made the court might not consider the fact that you did not actually know about the case. Service of an eviction case is properly made if it is served in hand to the defendant or if it is left at the residence and a second copy mailed. Even if the court would accept your reason for not appearing in court what defense would you have had to the eviction? I see on the court docket that your mother filed an Answer. I can't see the Answer as it isn't scanned into the system. Also the agreement made in the case is not scanned in. If you can provide me with information about these issues I might be able to provide you with additional advice.Are you able to post a copy of the housing denial? As I said in my previous reply you might have more success trying to appeal the denial than you may have trying to get the court judgment vacated. I have copied and pasted the docket entries from the eviction case below. When a judgment enters against multiple defendants for the same amount the defendants are ""jointly and severally liable."" This means that the plaintiff can recover the judgment against any or all of the defendants but the plaintiff cannot recover more than the total amount which in this case was $3987.67. If your mother has paid the judgment the plaintiff should have filed a ""satisfaction of judgment"" with the court. Even if you can't get the judgment vacated you should be able to get the landlord to file a notice of ""satisfaction of judgment."" That could help in any appeal of a housing denial.Once again I suggest you contact MetroWest Legal Services. I don't know whether they will be able to represent you but it they can it would be better to have direct representation. Here are the docket entries: ###754SU###.

In order to have the court record of the judgment against you changed either you or the lanldord would need to file a Motion for Relief from Judgment. If both parties agree (assent) to the motion the court should allow the motion and may do so without requiring a hearing. The landlord was represented by an attorney in this case so the court would probably require that the landlord's attorney sign the motion as being ""assented to."" When you speak with the landlord you should ask the landlord if they will assent to a motion for relief from judgment. If the landlord agrees you should make sure that the landlord's attorney will sign the motion as ""assented."" If the landlord's attorney is willing to file the motion that would be best. If the landlord's attorney isn't willing to file the motion you can file it preferably with the landlord's assent. If the landlord will not agree to do this you can file the motion based on the form below but without any indication that it is ""assented-to."" If you are not able to get the landlord's assent you will need to have a hearing. As I said in my previous reply it may be difficult for you to get the court to allow this motion without the landlord's assent.

You should use this only as a guide.  I am not able to speak with the landlord or the landlord's attorney on your behalf so I'm limited in what I can do to help you with this. The sample I attached includes the Affidavit from the website above. I did not edit that affidavit.

"START NEXT ""Mr. Lincomfelt I am very sorry to hear that your car was hit recently.  Based on the information you have provided however it does not sound like taking legal action against the police department is the best avenue for you to pursue.  Under Vehicle Code section 17001 the police department can be held liable for damage to property if that damage is caused by a negligent or wrongful act by a police officer when operating a police car.  But it seems unlikely that you could prove that the police were acting negligent or wrongful based on the information you have provided.  Further under Vehicle Code sections ### 21055 a police officer cannot be held liable for damage to property resulting from the operation of a police car when responding to an emergency call or when in the immediate pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of the law.  So even if it was the police car that had hit your car it seems unlikely that you would be able to recover damages from the police department based on the information you have provided. You may be able to recover damages through insurance or from the driver of the car that hit you however.  A few items to consider: Do you have car insurance?  If so I recommend that you report this accident to your insurance company.  They should be able to open a claim and investigation related to this incident and hopefully will then compensate you for the damages or repairs necessary to your car. Did you suffer any injuries as a result of the crash?  If so you should report those to your car insurance company as well so that you can be properly compensated for those injuries.Do you know the name of the driver who hit your car?  If so you can provide that information to your insurance company so that they can pursue contribution from that driver and/or his or her insurance company.  If you do not know the name of the driver your insurance company may be able to find out that information during their investigation.If you do not have car insurance then one final path you could pursue is contacting the police department to see if you can get the name of the driver who hit your car.  You could then decide if it is worth hiring a lawyer to pursue a civil claim against that driver for the damage to your car and any injuries you may have suffered. I hope that this information helps.  If you have any further questions please let me know.""",0,0

"START NEXT ""Hello I am a retired legal services lawyer in Bristol County who has volunteered to respond to some of the family law inquiries on Mass. Legal Answers On-line (""MLAO"").  I will try to respond helpfully to your inquiry.You did not say what your father has done to try to get custody of your son.  That might mean talk and threats physical intervention or legal action (for example a Petition for Guardianship in the appropriate Probate & Family Court).  If your situation already is in court on his petition for guardianship then you would have rights including to file an Answer denying any untrue allegations in his Petition and opposing his request for a guardianshp.  (The child's father also would have to be named as a party to a pending guardianship case.  I will assume that the child's father does not oppose your having custody of the child and is not seeking custody for himself -- which would complicate your case.)  Your rights in court also would include notice of every scheduled hearing and opportunities to be heard by the judge (and to reach settlements with the other parties which the judge might approve) to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses at a trial and to be represented by an attorney (when and if you can hire one). Your description of your father especially his poor health his advanced age his family history and his lack of means seem to me to make him an unlikely candidate to be awarded guardianship of your son.  Your son's bond with you and his special needs that you fulfill would be a close second factor in a judge's denying your father a guardianship.  Your father's allegedly rocky relationship with you might be far down the list of facts that a judge might consider to be relevant to your son's future custody.  (If a judge finds that the parents and the petitioner all are ""unfit"" to exercise custody at the time then the judge would have the authority to order DCF into the case for state custody at least as a temporary measure to protect the child's safety and welfare.) Your father would have difficult burdens of proof to demonstrate to a judge that it is necessary in the best interests of the child to award your father temporary or permanent guardianship:  he would have to prove {###} that you and the child's father are ""unfit"" at this time to care adequately for your son; and {###} that he (the maternal grandfather of the boy) is the best candidate to parent the child at this time.  Judges do not easily come to such conclusions; and the Constitutions of the United States and of Massachusetts (as interpreted by the highest judges) protect the rights of fit parents to raise their children without unnecessary intervention by the state or by other persons (including even kindly grandparents).  If your descriptions are accurate I do not foresee your father winning a guardianship that you oppose for good reasons in any Massachusetts court.However I cannot say if your ""fitness"" would come into question before a Probate & Family Court judge who was charged with deciding if a guardianship was necessary in the best interests of your son.  Your homelessness and lack of means might be of some concern to a judge although I will assume that your brother would testify as to the great care that you still are providing to your son (with his help).  Your blaming your father (for preventing you from relocating?  for your other short-comings?) probably would not be enough to dissuade a judge from considering all the alleged facts presented to the court regarding what situation would be best for your son at this time).  Testimony and statements from your son's teachers doctors and social workers in support of your care of your son at this time would be more persuasive to a judge than throwing blame on your father (even if he deserves it) because it is your custodial fitness that you will most have to defend if this case gets to court.  In some cases like this where there are contradictory statements made to the judge by the opposing parties the judge may appoint someone (called a ""guardian ad litem"" or a ""GAL"") to investigate the allegations and to report to the court whatever he or she finds regarding the child's best interests in the current circumstances.  If you are doing as good a job of parenting as you described then I would guess that you would have nothing to fear from such an investigation which might easily resolve all the controversy in your favor. If you have additional questions and/or information regarding your situation you may forward it through MLAO within the next week; and I would try to respond again to those.  Good luck!         "" NEXT ""Are there any specific forms i need? And do the statements from the various people I am getting statements from need to be notarized? Or can they just be written statements? And do you know if there any of the forms I may need online and downloadable?  I am in another state currently amd trying to reserve money for the trip back up there for court on ###th.  All help is truly appreciated.  Thank you so much for your time and attention.### ###"" NEXT ""Hello again.  To respond to your questions about statements to use in court I suggest that you obtain sworn statements (signed under the pains and penalties of perjury and notarized according to the law of the state in which you reside).  I also had suggested that the statements that you collect and use be from persons with personal knowledge of what they state and that the persons be available to testify under oath in the Massachusetts court in the event that later there is a full trial.  Since you have disclosed that you reside in another state I infer that some (or all) of your helpful witnesses may not be available to travel and testify in person in Massachusetts.  So I will add a note about using sworn statements. Written statements can be used in the early part of a case to try to persuade the judge that not everything the opposing party alleges is true or at least that there is a real controversy and opposing allegations about what is true.  (You also might persuade the opposing party to be more reasonable or to give up his claims based on the strength of your evidence.)  In the early part of a custody case (for example on most motions for temporary orders) the judge is asked to make temporary orders that may remain in effect until there is a trial and a final judgment usually based on oral statements from the opposing parties [your plan for your oral statements should include mostly statements of relevant alleged facts for the judge to know supported by an outline of your argument why the judge (in the best interests of the child) should order what you are asking and should deny what the opposing party is asking].  The temporary orders made early in each case often have real effects and real consequences even though the final judgment can go in the opposite direction.  So in summary use written statements to support your oral statements that you plan to make for the judge at the scheduled hearing (tailor your statements to what is scheduled to be decided); and know which of the persons have agreed to testify in person at a future trial (in case the judge asks).  If any witness refuses to give a sworn statement consider their reasons and whether their unsworn statement would be helpful to your own statements that you will be making under oath.I am not sure what ""forms"" you are asking about.  In general the Massachusetts Probate & Family Courts have a variety of forms that can be used for a variety of purposes.  For example they have complaints (and petitions) for every type of case that anyone would want to commence (in probate matters and in family law matters).  They also have motion forms and affidavit forms and various other forms that may be used.  You can pick up blank forms from the Register's Office when you go to the courthouse; or you may find copies on-line (I believe at masscourts.gov) or in Mass Practice vol. ###-###.  To create an affidavit or a motion however you are not required to use the court-created forms.  If you have seen a Massachusetts motion you may create your own motion following the same format:  i.e. a ""caption"" at the top that identifies the case and the document then the content then the date and signature block.  A notary in your state should be able to help you with the format of a sworn affidavit [using the ""caption"" for your Massachusetts case].I do not know if you have filed and served an ""Answer"" or if the deadline has passed.  The Massachusetts Probate & Family Court has no standard Answer form that you could use.  (Mass Practice or on-line resources might have suggestive models.)  It is not absolutely necessary to file and serve your ""Answer"" to the Plaintiff's Complaint although it does put the Plaintiff and the Court on notice that you object to the orders and the relief that the Plaintiff has requested in his Complaint; so it could be useful.     Good luck!""",1,1

In other words you can leave your child alone for a reasonable period time. There is no blanket provision stating that you cannot leave your child unattended until she reaches the age of ###. In determining what is an ""unreasonable period of time"" there are several factors the statute considers including but not limited to: the age of the child;the number of children left at the location;special needs of the child including any disability or prescribed medical treatment;the duration of time in which the child was left;the condition and location of the place where the child was left;the time of day the child was left;the weather conditions including whether there was adequate protection from natural elements such as heat or light;the location of the parent at the time the child was left without supervision;whether the child's movement was locked within a room or other structure;whether the child was given a phone number of a person in the event of an emergency and whether the child was capable of making an emergency call; andwhether there was food left for the child.Additionally the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services has provided information on how to prepare your child to be left at home (available here).

Paternity:  When a child is born outside of a marriage you have to establish paternity to determine the legal rights between the two parents.

The forms to do this if you have to without an attorney are located at www.indianalegalhelp.org in the ### and Forms link.  Review the forms in the ""Custody"" link there to find the right forms for your circumstances.  To get any support you will need to go to court.Because you were not married the financial obligations between the two of you will primarily deal with support and care of your children.  Without a marriage or an agreement to share assets in lieu of marriage you both are pretty much on your own.  You may have established contractual relationships (buying a car together for example) voluntarily but otherwise neither of you will have the obligation to support one another.

"START NEXT ""Dear Ms. ###Your question concerns both unemployment and pandemic unemployment assistance benefits so I will briefly touch on both.Unemployment BenefitsIn general a claimant qualifies for unemployment when they are separated from employment through no fault of their own. If the claimant voluntarily quit they must have good work-related ###ons for doing so. If the claimant was discharged the discharging employer must not have good cause for the discharge. In addition to the no-fault requirement the claimant must have sufficient earnings in their base period and must be able available and actively seeking full-time employment. Additional information on these requirements can be found in the attached Claimant Handbook.When an employee is injured on the job the normal recourse is worker's compensation benefits as opposed to unemployment. You mentioned a ""Work Comp doctor"" so it sounds like you rightly pursued worker's compensation benefits following your injury in December of ###. I will also note that if a claimant is unable to work because of an injury they are generally not able and available for full-time employment and so are not eligible for benefits.PUA BenefitsA claimant may qualify for PUA benefits if they were unemployed as a direct result of COVID-19 were working or scheduled to start working at the time of the COVID-### (###) and were able and available for work except for the COVID-###. Section B of the attached Frequently Asked Questions pdf contains among other information a list of acceptable COVID-related ###ons for being unemployed.Based on the facts you have provided it is not clear that you meet the above requirements.

Without a proper motion (or complaint) that focusses on the errors of court and on the pertinent facts I am afraid that you might not get the legal relief that you deserve.  Not only can I not answer all your questions and give you good guidance for you to do it yourself it sounds like you are near your ### ends unnecessarily stressed by the recent legal goings-on.So I recommend that you now retain a good family law attorney to represent you in this matter.

These legal organizations that provide free services cannot accept every application; and despite the apparent merits of your case they might not accept your application.  You might also find help through your local Seniors Center.

"START NEXT ""Minimum wage laws apply to employees rather than independent contractors. If they were being issued ###099s instead of W-2s then they were being treated as independent contractors. If I as your attorney agree to do work for you based upon a given price per unit and it takes me so long to perform the work that I end up earning less than minimum wage that is on me not you.That said it seems questionable that these women were technically independent contractors. Many business owners incorrectly believe that they can ""hire"" folks as either an ""employee"" or an ""independent contractor."" That is absolutely false. The law dictates whether it is an ### relationship or an independent contractor relationship. The IRS has established a ###. None of the ###. Do they perform the work at the business location? Do they use business tools or equipment? Does the business dictate the work hours? These are the types of things that are considered and if the answers to those three questions are ""yes"" then it is likely that the employer has ""misclassified"" them as independent contractors rather than employees. If you look up ""misclassification"" on the Missouri Department of Labor website you will find a great deal of information including that the business can be subject to ###; monetary penalties of up to $######; up to 25% increased unemployment taxes. Additionally if the employer was not carrying worker's compensation insurance on them there could be criminal and monetary penalties associated with that as well.Based upon what you have indicated you are kidding yourself if you think the employer won't immediately know that you are the one that has filed or at least assisted in bringing this complaint. From a legal standpoint there isn't much that the company can do but it is likely that the company will try to make it difficult for you to get further employment. I assume that you won't be using the employer as a reference but some employers may insist on speaking with them. You mention that you are in ### County which is good as if you lived and worked in a small rural county the business would have an easier time poisoning the well (badmouthing you to most viable employers). If the employer does choose to do that to you there are legal remedies (such as defamation) but those are very difficult to prove.Technically the seamstresses don't have to submit anything themselves and the spreadsheet should be sufficient to get things going. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) it is the employer's burden to maintain records confirming that it is paying employees the correct amount. Once the complaint is filed the Wage and Hour Division will send someone to the facility and interview each of the employees privately. To the extent that you are concerned about being held liable yourself that isn't likely. You can certainly provide an affidavit that issuing payment by signing checks wasn't your job but that you had been directed to do so on occasion. However you had no authority to issue payment other than on the basis that the employer dictated despite your having advised the employer that it was violating the law.""",0,0

"START NEXT ""It is not unusual for a party to have his/her child added under a new spouse's insurance policy.  However whether or not that is in full compliance of the court order that was entered will depend heavily on the exact wording of the order entered.  On a conceptual basis typically court orders requiring a party to provide his/her child with medical insurance are there so that the child has insurance coverage. There may be more at play here than simply the child obtaining/maintaining an insurance policy.  The cost of the insurance is often included in the calculation of the child support guidelines.  So the child support guidelines calculation run may have included a higher amount for the cost of the insurance which would potentially lower the father's monthly child support payment if in fact the insurance premium paid is lwoer than the number that was included in the guidelines.  If the Mother learns of the lower cost of the insurance she may  have a basis for an upward modification of the father's child support monthly amount depending on the number that was used in the guidelines calculation.The best practice would be to have a qualified family law attorney reveiw all the court documents and give advice specific to the situation at hand.

The party who would have a much better chance to try to undo the boyfriend's paternity would be the biological father.  If you can get him to file a paternity/non-paternity petition it would have greater chances of success.  But of course he is not required to do so.Judges vary tremendously in strictly enforcing the law.  However regardless who files the lawsuit seeking to undo the BVR legal paternity and establish a judgment against the biological father the judge will usually have to appoint an attorney to serve as the child's attorney.  This is known as a Guardian ad Litem and the judge will order the parties to pay the attorney.  The majority of cases seeking to replace a legal father with a biological father usually succeed.  However the individual circumstances and facts are different in every case.  If the child now recognizes his legal father (boyfriend) as his father and has established a parent-child bond this will be taken into account.  The Guardian ad Litem can make a recommendation to the court that it is not in the best interests of the child to disestablish paternity.  I cannot guess about the outcome of your situation but can say that most times it is legally possible to accomplish your litigation goals.You cannot use genetic testing materials from another case or cases to have paternity tests for this child.  In addition as previously explained it does not matter if the legal father is not the biological father.  Having the genetic testing results changes nothing legally.  Also any DNA testing done prior to the court case being filed may be excluded by the judge.  You should wait and do the genetic testing pursuant to a court order after the case is filed.Your next step is to hire a good local family la attorney who can review the factual and legal history with you and advise you as to your legal options.  The situation you have created is not something you can repair yourself and you will need a good lawyer.Best wishes.""",0,0

"START NEXT ""Greetings Mr. ###.  The best advice I can give you is to see if you can get an attorney to represent you.  As you are on this forum I suspect that may be financially difficult but I would encourage you to keep trying. An Order to Show Cause is used in a contempt proceeding to try to compel someone to follow an existing order.  That is not going to help you.  The situation you are describing is one where you need to modify the custody order to reflect the reality of the situation.  I would be surprised if the Judge does that in one fell swoop at the next hearing. There are ultimately only two ways the custody order gets modified.  The first is if you and the mother agree to the modification and the Judge approves your agreement through an order.  The other is by having contested court proceedings and letting the Judge make the decision. Assuming the mother will not agree to the modification you will need to file a motion in the existing custody order file asking the Court to modify the custody order and to grant you physical custody until a full hearing can be had on the motion.  I would suggest accompanying that with an Affidavit explaining the facts of the situation.  You will then want to try to get a short hearing scheduled for the Judge to consider your request for physical custody while your motion is pending and to schedule any further hearings that may be necessary. It is difficult to give you good advice on what evidence to present.  Generally speaking evidence needs to be presented to the Court through the testimony of witnesses with firsthand knowledge of what they are testifying to.  You can act as a witness as can the mother.  If you have other reliable witnesses you may want to have them testify. It is difficult to fully explain how to represent yourself and there is a lot that can go wrong.  If you are able to find a lawyer to assist you I suggest doing so. "" NEXT ""I have talked with my son's mother and we have reached an agreement she is willing to sign an order if I draft it up. I had already put in an Order to Show Cause. So if I now fill out a motion to modify the custody agreement and we both sign it in front of a notary will that void the order to show cause? Do I have to modify the ### agreement or can I draft up a new one and attach the old one? Any advice would be much appreciated name of the motion I must file tips on how to file it etc.  Thank you so much for taking your time to give me advice about the situation I really appreciate it."" NEXT ""The absolute basics of modifying custody if she is willing sign an agreement would be the written agreement and an order signed by the Judge approving the agreement and making it an order of the Court.  South Dakota does not have any forms for these.  The new agreement could fully replace prior terms or it could supplement them - it depends on what it says. If you are not able to get a lawyer to help you I would suggest typing up the terms of your agreement as best you can both signing it before a notary or the clerk of court and filing it.  That at the very least demonstrates that you have a mutual understanding regarding what you are doing but it does not have the force of a court order unless the Judge approves it.  To make that happen you would need to set a hearing for the court to review the order.  That could come with some risks that the court might reject the agreement particularly if it does not address child support.  You probably want the agreement to deal with child support in a perfect world but that might also prompt her to not agree.  If the plan is for no one to pay child support you will probably have to rely on ### 25-7-6.###. https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/2050114  Again if you can find a lawyer to assist you that would be ideal.

"START NEXT ""From your question it's hard to tell what your goals are with regard to the DNA testing and your children but it seems like you have two questions: First when was DNA testing done presumably by DSS and was it appropriate for those test results to determine your paternity of the three children? Second if DSS has said that you are the father why are they denying your rights as the dad to see your children? For the first question laws regarding establishing and challenging paternity through DNA testing or voluntary acknowledgment are found in South Dakota Codified Laws Chapter ###5-8. You can read the whole thing at this link: https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=###5-8If you signed an affidavit of paternity at the children's births then you have already voluntarily acknowledged that you are the dad. That would put you on the children's birth certificates and that's good enough for any court or DSS. You are now presumed to be the father and DNA tests should not be necessary. I don't know why or how DSS conducted a paternity test on you if you didn't give them any samples but I would just go to the office that sent you that letter and ask them. In any case other than your voluntary acknowledgment as the dad only a court can make a legally-enforceable finding of paternity. For your second question if you want to see your children and the mother is denying you visitation you will have to file a petition in court to get your visitation rights recognized and enforced. It is best to have a lawyer to help you with this process. South Dakota has standard parenting guidelines which used to be called visitation guidelines. These guidelines are supposed to apply to every separated couple with children unless ###) there's some valid reason to not follow the guidelines or ###) the parents agree to some different arrangement. But if the parents disagree the guidelines will usually apply. You can read the guidelines at this link:https://ujs.sd.gov/uploads/pubs/UJS%###030###%###0-%###0South%###0Dakota%###0Visitation%###0Guidelines.pdfWhat your lawyer would likely do is file a petition to have these guidelines apply in your case and ask the court to order both parents to comply. But that's just an example; those choices would be between you and your attorney based on the specific facts in your case. I hope the information in this response has been helpful to you. """,0,0

It takes a lawsuit and service of the summons or posting and a court date and a judgment for the plaintiff before the landlord may have the sheriff carry out the eviction.  What matters is compliance with the lease an unfortunately not the tenantâ€™s reasons for not paying rent.  She should contact the landlordâ€™s attorney and tender the rent and all sums due. Best wishes. """,0,0

"START NEXT ""Hello ### I am sorry to hear about the difficulty that you are having. In some situations a person's testimony is the only way to prove ownership of property. This sounds like one of those instances. Physical evidence such as the receipt you described or photographs of your wife possessing the ring throughout the years would also support that testimony.To prove the existence of a gift the law is as follows: ""Where defendant claims ownership as a gift he is required to prove by clear and convincing evidence donative intent the ### parting with exclusive ### and control over the subject of the gift and delivery to the donee. *** Donative intent is determined at the time of the alleged transfer of property and is controlled by what the parties said or did at the time of the transaction and not what is said at a later time."" Koerner v. ### ### (1st) 122980.Based on the description that you provided it sounds like the ring was delivered to your wife with the intent that she possess it exclusively. As a result her testimony and yours could establish the gift and your wife's ownership of the ring. If your mother-in-law testifies differently then it would be up to the finder of fact (judge or jury) to decide who to believe at a trial. Of course you will have to weigh what impact that will have on your familial relationship before deciding upon any course of action.I hope that this helps to provide you with some guidance.""",0,0
