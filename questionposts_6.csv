The second question seems to be if you can stop your child from seeing the counselor your ex-wife has started taking him to, and the answer to that is no. After reviewing your decree you attached, it is pretty clear on page ### 3(e) that you are entitled to all the same information for medical, psychological, or other health care matters. You can provide this court order to the person treating your son currently, or you may have to take them to court to gain access to the information. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that you would be able to prevent your child from seeing this therapist/counselor. Your ex-wife is entitled to take the child to medical providers she deems appropriate when she has time with your child, a right you are afforded as well. You can choose not to take your child to this counselor if it is during your parenting time, and you can also have your child see another counselor of your choice at the same time. But there is nothing that gives you veto power over which provider your wife chooses for your child as well. I can see you were previously represented by Alex Sitz. You could always give him a call to get more detailed information and see if he can help you file something to gain access to your son's medical files, but in reality if you brought a copy of this court order to the medical provider and highlighted the section 3(e), I'd guess they would provide it to you, especially if you told them otherwise you will be going to the court to have the order enforced against them (a situation you might likely be able to also ask the court to make them cover your attorney fees for, as well).I hope this helps, best of luck.
